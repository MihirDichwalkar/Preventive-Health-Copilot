    "The evaluation of the Preventive Health Copilot agent across four prompt strategies (Baseline, Improved Reasoning, Structured ReAct, and Production-Ready ReAct) aimed to enhance the provision of structured, non-medical health advice and tool usage.\n",

    "The Production-Ready ReAct Prompt proved most successful, significantly improving the agent's performance by incorporating detailed structure, safety rules, and explicit tool guidelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Observations**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Production-Ready Prompt is Superior: Achieved the highest Overall Score (3.0) and Query Relevance (4.4). This confirms that clear instructions and ReAct-style examples aid the agent in understanding intent and applying tools correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Prompt Adherence Challenge: All prompts struggled with Prompt Adherence (1.0 to 1.8). The LLama 3.1 model found it difficult to strictly follow the complex, multi-step instructions and the required JSON-like output format.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Accuracy Stable: Response Accuracy (2.6-2.8) remained consistent across structured prompts, showing the model reliably provides sound, general health advice.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "The iterative progression to the Production-Ready ReAct Prompt created a more reliable AI agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Refined Structure is Crucial: The most successful prompt used strict rules and a rigid final output schema, leading to the highest overall quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Trade-offs: Despite low adherence to the exact JSON output, the overall quality, Query Relevance, and Procedural Correctness were substantially improved, making the Production-Ready ReAct Prompt the best strategy for a production environment.\n",
